Created by Nate Gamble March 12, 2020

-----------------------------
Project started with help from Facebook's create-react-app on Github.
Uses Cloud Firestore to store, edit and delete todo objects.

Each TODO is added by writing in the text box and pressing Enter
TODOs will have an associated checkmark and delete icon
If a TODO has been completed, the checkmark can be clicked to cross out the TODO
Completed TODOs will be separated from uncompleted TODOs
Completed and uncompleted TODOS can be deleted by clicking the delete icon
TODOS will be ordered by time added, with more recent TODOs at the top
